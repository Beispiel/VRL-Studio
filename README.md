Innovative IDE based on VRL (Visual Reflection Library)

VRL-Studio is an innovative Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on the Java Platform that combines both visual and text-based programming. In contrast to many other Development Environments VRL-Studio Projects are fully functional programs that are developed at run-time. This makes it an ideal environment for rapid prototyping, teaching and experimentation.
